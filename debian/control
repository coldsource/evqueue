 .
 It provides both simple task execution and complex task chaining
 (workflow) using an easy to use drag & drop web interface. Workflow
 description includes output linking to input, conditions, loops...
 Queues management provides an easy way for task parallelization and
 resource control.

 The network API provides an easy way, XML based, for synchronous or
 asynchronous workflow launching and control, allowing tasks to be
 launched from external applications or web pages. You can thus execute
 heavy tasks on a remote (dedicated) machine to save resources on your
 web frontends while providing live reporing of the treatment to you users.
